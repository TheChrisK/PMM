Plex Meta Manager is an open source Python 3 project that has been designed to ease the creation and maintenance of metadata, collections, and playlists within a Plex Media Server. The script is designed to be run continuously and be able to update information based on sources outside your plex environment. Plex Meta Manager supports Movie/TV/Music libraries and Playlists.

## Getting Started

1. Install Plex Meta Manager; this process is described [here](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/installation.html).

2. Once installed, you have to create a [Configuration File](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/config/configuration.html), which contains URLs and credentials and the like which are used to connect to services like Plex and TMDB.

3. After that you can start updating Metadata and building automatic Collections by creating a [Metadata File](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/metadata/metadata.html) for each Library you want to interact with.

4. After that, explore the [Wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/) to see all the different Collection Builders that can be used to create collections.

## Walkthroughs

If you find steps 1-3 above daunting, there are some walkthroughs available that will take you through those three steps: getting Plex Meta Manager installed, creating a config file, and creating a couple collections to show how the process works.

   1. The [Local Walkthrough](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/guides/local.html) covers installing the script natively [not in docker] on your local computer or a remote server.
   2. The [Docker Walkthrough](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/guides/docker.html) covers the same thing, running the script via Docker.
   3. The [unRAID Walkthrough](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/guides/unraid.html) gets you started configuring the script in UNRaid.  It doesn't go through the same steps with regard to creating the config file and metadata file, so you may want to go through the [Docker Walkthrough](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/guides/docker.html) first on your computer to gain that understanding.

## Development & Nightly Builds

### Development

[![Develop GitHub commits since latest stable release (by SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/meisnate12/plex-meta-manager/latest/develop?label=Commits%20in%20Develop&style=plastic)](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/develop)

The [develop](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/develop) branch has the most updated **documented** fixes and enhancements to Plex Meta Manager.  This version is tested and documented to some degree, but it is still an active development branch, so there may be rough edges.

If switching to the develop build, it is recommended to also use the [develop branch of the wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/en/develop/), which documents any changes made from the Master build.

### Nightly

[![Nightly GitHub commits since latest stable release (by SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/meisnate12/plex-meta-manager/latest/nightly?label=Commits%20in%20Nightly&style=plastic)](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/nightly)

There is also a [nightly](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/nightly) build which will have the absolute latest version of the script, but it could easily break, there is no guarantee that it even works, and any new features will not be documented.

**This branch will have squashed commits which can cause `git pull`/`git fetch` to error you can use `git reset origin/nightly --hard` to fix the branch.**

As this build is subject to extreme change, there is no promise of the feature being documented in the [nightly](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/) branch of the wiki and all discussions relating to changes made in the nightly build will be held within the [Plex Meta Manager Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NfH6mGFuAB).

## Example Usage

Plex Meta Manager gives the user the power to curate a set of Collections to make discovering and organizing media easy. They can be built either using plex-based searches/filters, or by using popular builders such as TMDb, IMDb, Trakt, MDBList, MyAnimeList and many more.

Some example collections that can be created are:
  * Trending/Popular (based on TMDb, IMDb, Trakt, etc.)
  * Streaming Service (such as Netflix, Disney+, etc.)
  * Networks
  * Studios
  * Genres
  * Actors
  * Decades

Below are some user-curated collections which have been created by Plex Meta Manager.

To see user submitted Metadata configuration files, and you to even add your own, go to the [Plex Meta Manager Configs](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager-Configs).

Plex Meta Manager can manage the metadata fields for movies, shows, seasons, episodes, artists, albums, tracks, and collections, which can allow you to have a full backup of your customizations in case of a database loss.

## IBRACORP Video Walkthrough

[IBRACORP](https://ibracorp.io/) made a video walkthrough for installing Plex Meta Manager on unRAID. While you might not be using unRAID the video goes over many key aspects of Plex Meta Manager and can be a great place to start learning how to use the script.
